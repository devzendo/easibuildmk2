The Arduino IDE libraries in the Libraries folder are licensed under their own
licenses, please check the zip files there, and their respective websites,
details of which you'll find in the EasiBuildMk2.ino file.

To set up the libraries in the Arduino IDE:
1) SCoop. Create a folder called SCoop in your Arduino IDE's libraries folder
   (e.g. mine is ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries on OSX). Extract the 'SCoop V1.2
   New Year Pack.zip' file to a temporary folder, then copy SCoop/SCoop.{cpp|h}
   into the libraries/SCoop folder you created.
2) LiquidCrystal - can be added as a .zip library.
3) EnableInterrupt - don't know yet....
